VideoScrobbler
==============

A service to scrobble your video watching habits to, so that you can keep track of what you've watched and what you haven't. Should ultimately build up a pretty awesome database of different people's likes and dislikes.

To Do
-----
* Get on the CSS
* Build the /api/auth page (turns tokens into session keys; allows users to authenticate an app)
* Set up somewhere for people to ask questions about this project â€” for now I guess use my [formspring](http://www.formspring.me/jphastings) or [tweet to me](http://twitter.com/jphastings).
